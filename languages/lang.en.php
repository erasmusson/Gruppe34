The campus is merely a 5-10 minute walk away from oslo central station.
</br>
</br>
 
The new campus is centrally located by the Akerselva river on the southmost part of Grünerløkka, within walking distance of Torggate. Close to Fjerdingen you’ll find many small cafés, restaurants and bars. The district is also very popular for shopping. Just north of Grünerløkka is Torshov, with cultural centers like Soria Moria and Trikkestallen, a more calm area with large parks and relaxing cafés.
</br>
</br>
 
the campus is built with daytime educating in mind, but it’s a good fit for project work in groups or on your own in the evening hours. Life as a student doesn’t just revolve around the studies, and the location is well equipped for parties, exhibitions, concerts and other types of events.";
